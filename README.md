# GraphicSystem.java 
## The following Java program is an academic project that implements a graphical user interface using the OOPGraphics library. 
The program creates a window with a text field and a help button. When the user enters a command in the text field and presses enter, the program processes the command and performs the corresponding action, such as drawing shapes, changing colors, or saving the current state of the canvas. The program requires a jar file, specifically the uk.ac.leedsbeckett.oop.OOPGraphics jar file, which provides the OOPGraphics class and its methods for creating and manipulating graphical objects. This jar file is not part of the standard Java library, I have added it to the repository, it needs to be included in the classpath when compiling and running the program.
